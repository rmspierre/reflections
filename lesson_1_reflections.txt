How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Seriously? Uhm, duh.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual is more accurate. Automatic is more lazy.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because they have diffferent intended uses (and Google just wants access to your data, not to help you with it).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
cd to dir where project exists, then use 'git log' to view a list of the commits and commit IDs. Use 'git diff ID1 ID2' to compare commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Seriously? Uhm, duh!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For a while
